<h1>Stock App</h1>

The main objective of this project is to create a visualization of a stock's price over the course of one year. The project entails utilizing the AlphaVantage API: https://www.alphavantage.co/, the StockData API: https://www.stockdata.org/documentation, and D3.

In the Stock App, users will be able to:
1) input a publicly traded U.S. stock ticker name.
2) view the daily closing price of that stock on a line graph over the last 52-week period.
3) view the minimum and maximum price, and see what the maximum profit could have been in the 52-week range.
4) hover over the line graph to view the daily stock price.

In addition, this project will include:

1) a link to the line graph of the most recently searched stock ticker.
2) README.md file.
