# JavaScript-Project-1

This project entails utilizing the AlphaVantage API: https://www.alphavantage.co/
The main objective is to create a visualization of a stock's price over the course of one year.

This will be performed in 3 steps:
1) the user will input the stock ticker name.
2) the stock's daily price will be pulled from the above API.
3) the price over the last year will be displayed on a line graph using D3.
4) the user can hover over the graph to see daily stock prices.
